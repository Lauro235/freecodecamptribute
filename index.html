          <h2>Early years</h2>
            <p>Born on the 25th of December 1987, Lage was a child prodigy on the guitar, playing with Artists like Carlos Santana, David Grisman and Gary Burton, before leaving high school. He has a huge wealth of experience to draw from, both as a sideman and as a band leader. He is one of my favorite guitar players for both emotional rawness, nuiance and abstract musical ideas. He has cited big influences from Jim Hall and Django Reinhardt all the way to some slightly surpising influences like Elliot Smith and Roy Orbison.</p>
          <h2>Music as a family affair</h2>      
            <p>His Portuguese roots from his dad gave him the name Lage (pronounced Large without the r). When Julian was just 4 years old, his dad began playing guitar and Julian began shortly afterwards sharing his learning with his father.</p>
            <p>Julian's dad had a big influence on Julians early development. He would teach Julian things that he had been learning. "That was what was so fun about it, he would come home and show me what he'd learnt from his lessons... He'd sit in with me as I studied in lesson".
            When Julian was a young guitarist Randy Vincent was his main guru. His dad would help Julian understand all the nuiance of Randy's advice from his lessons.</p>
          <h2>Music around the home</h2>
            <p>Records from Julian's childhood included Jobim, John Martyn, James Taylor, John Coltranes Giant Steps and Julia Fordham on his dads side. His mother, having grown up on the East coast had influences drawing from RnB and motown. Artists like BB King, John Lee Hooker, Aretha Franklin and Etta James.</p>
            <p>Julian has been described as a dazzling player with great emotional and technical command of the guitar. He is repeatedly described as one of the most creative jazz guitarists in the world.</p>
